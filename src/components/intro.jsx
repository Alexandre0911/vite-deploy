                I'm a back-end developer, I mostly code in Python but
                I have some practice with JavaScript aswell.
                I am currently trying to expand my horizons studying C++ & Java
                for back-end developing.<br />
                This website was built with the purpose of me trying out
                React and TailwindCSS (which went going great).<br />
                Right now, I am looking forward to try and solve everyday
                problems and to automate simple/boring tasks until
                I have enough experience to start developing games.
