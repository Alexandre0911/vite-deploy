        I gave up after trying to build a discord bot without \
        having prior programming experience. \
        One year later, I started reading about Python online \
        and all the projects you would be able to build with it \
        and I fell in love with Python, which I keep studying \
        and practicing everyday.",

        duration: "5 days",
        details: "For 5 years, I have been coding simple programs \
        but none of them were actual projects as I never had much creativity... \
        But this year, 2023, I thought I had finally found a Junior Developer \
        Job. I applied and they sent me an exercise. I would have to create a \
        Folder Synchronizer either in Python or C++. I completed the project but, \
        unfortunately, someone with a college degree got the job. No hard feelings, \
        This made me learn how to use more things in my Python programs. And I use \
        the Folder Synchronizer on my daily basis as it's very useful!",

        but realised you are not subscribed to premium? Worry no more! \
        Due to some friends suggesting that I should make a program \
        for them to download music from spotify playlists, I started developing \
        'Spotify Playlist Downloader'. Even though it's about spotify, \
        all the songs are downloaded from youtube. Ironic I would say. \

        Before starting this project, I had little knowledge of JavaScript, \
        much less of Vite. Creating this portfolio made me search about vite, \
        how to deploy it on github as a page, and how to use tailwind and react.",
